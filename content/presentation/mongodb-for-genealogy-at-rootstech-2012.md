After an enjoyable time at the SORT conference in 2011 I was invited to
come back to SLC to present at the RootsTech Genealogy conference.

The two hardest data types to model are e-commerce and genealogy. There
really just isn’t any good way to do it in a relational database.
MongoDB is the answer Genealogy developers have been looking for for a
very long time. A flexible schema that allows adhoc searching,
horizontal scale and full data integrity. The following presentation
covers MongoDB fundamentals, how to build a graph in MongoDB, how model
genealogical data.
