This is a 90 minute MongoDB tutorial on using MongoDB in PHP which I gave as a
webcast for O'Reilly last year.. The tutorial covers everything from Installing
MongoDB along with installing and configuring the MongoDB PHP driver. You will
learn how to work with MongoDB from within PHP as well as within the MongoDB
shell.

What would happen if you optimized a data store for the operations application
developers to actually use? You'd arrive at MongoDB, the reliable
document-oriented database. In this webcast presentation by Steve Francia,
author of MongoDB and PHP, you will learn how to build elegant database
applications with MongoDB and PHP.
