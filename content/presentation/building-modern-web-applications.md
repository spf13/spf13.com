I gave this presentation to a packed house at DevCon5 in NYC July 24th.  DevCon5
is a web developers conference and this year it focused on HTML5.  This was one
of the hardest presentations I've worked on for the simple fact that the
audience had name recognition, but not familiarity with the database industry.
Typically I've leaned on the fact that most participants were familiar with at
least one database prior to my presentation, I had no such luxury here.  After
weeks of work, I think it turned out pretty well.  

During the live presentation I focused heavily on audience participation.
DevCon5 provided some of the most thoughtful responses and questions I've ever
had participating.  I really enjoyed giving this presentation and the many
discussions that followed.
