I had the unique opportunity to present at the annual technology forum
[Insight Venture Partners](http://www.insightpartners.com/) holds for
their portfolio companies. Over 100 CTOs gathered in NYC to hear from
great presenters from companies like [10gen](http://10gen.com),
[Tumblr](http://tumblr.com),
[Shutterstock](http://www.shutterstock.com/) and [Buddy
Media](http://buddymedia.com/).

I’ve included a slightly longer version of the presentation given which
includes a few slides that I cut out for brevity to fit in the allocated
time while still allowing time for questions.

[Another presentation I gave is
similar](http://spf13.com/post/mongodb-sort-conference-2011) but takes a
broader review on MongoDB, including example schemas, queries and how
sharding and replication work with MongoDB.
