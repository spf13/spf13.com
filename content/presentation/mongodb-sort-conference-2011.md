This presentation was given at the LDS Tech SORT Conference 2011 in Salt
Lake City. The slides are quite comprehensive covering many topics on
MongoDB. Rather than a traditional presentation, this was presented as
more of a Q & A session. Topics covered include. Introduction to
MongoDB, Use Cases, Schema design, High availability (replication) and
Horizontal Scaling (sharding).
