Open Source licensing can be a confusing and daunting task. Most
developers simply adopt licenses of other popular projects. I wanted to
shed some light on the most popular licenses and provide some guidance
on which one should be used and when.

*Disclaimer: I’m not a lawyer, I am not qualified to nor am I imparting
sound legal advice.*

BSD & [MIT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License "MIT License")
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Both licenses are very similar. They are very liberal and allow for
sub-licensing meaning that any derived works may be released under a
different (commercial or otherwise) license.

What they primarily accomplish is mandating that the [copyright
notice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright "Copyright") remains in
place and the disclaimer that the software is without warranty.

The [BSD
license](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses "BSD licenses") is a
bit more specific on how the copyright notice needs to be displayed.

GPL
---

This is the most popular Open Source license. Without a full description
of what the GPL does, as there are many places to find this, the GPL is
a true Open Source license in the sense that it enforces that derivitave
works must retain same license. In doing so it ensures that Open Sourced
items remain open source. It does this by enforcing this based on
distribution of binaries.

LGPL
----

The LGPL is substantly the same as the GPL with one major difference. It
permits for inclusion within other projects with different (including
propriatary) licenses. A good read explaining when to use this vs the
GPL is located here. 
[http://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html)

AGPL
----

The AGPL is again substantly the same as the GPL but addressing the fact
that today distributing binaries is becoming less common, falling to
providing access on a server. The AGPL address this by requiring
enforcement based on if it is accessible from a network (ala a web
site).
