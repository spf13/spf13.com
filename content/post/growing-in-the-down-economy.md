Trimming the Fat
================

I am all in favor of trimming the fat. Every company has inefficiencies
and employees that aren’t adding value to the company. This exercise of
fat trimming should be an ongoing exercise, quarterly. If a company
larger than 200 employees is firing 10% or more of their employees they
have a serious management issue. No well run company can operate
efficiently with 10%+ of “fat”, and no company can expect to grow while
letting go 10%+ of their staff. While wall street praises companies for
taking bold drastic action, all the while they are destroying both the
company, and the country that supports them.

How to Grow in the Down Economy
===============================

*Stop thinking of it as a down economy*. Think of it as a great time for
growth. Consider the facts.. A surplus of talented and desperate labor
just hit the market. All your competitors have elected to stop trying to
grow, and instead decided to lower their goals to survival. Even with
revised lower projections, they are substantially missing them. It is
not a question of a bad economy for many companies, but rather a
question of attitude. If the goal is survival, than how can one expect
to excel.

If you must downsize
====================

Make it your last option. Smart companies
like [Seagate](http://www.seagate.com "Seagate Technology") had all
their upper management take substantial salary cuts, saving thousands of
jobs. [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com "Microsoft") offered
severance packages and is relocating many of the workers from cut
departments to other areas of the company.
