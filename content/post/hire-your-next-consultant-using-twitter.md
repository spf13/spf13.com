At Portero we had an issue with our network.

I know enough
about networking to understand the basics. I actually used to work on
the [IOS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_IOS "Cisco IOS") back
during the dawn of the internet. Though things have changed since then,
the biggest issue is I don’t remember enough to fix network
configuration issues on the router level.

Before I took the post at Portero, we had a company we contracted to
configure all of our [Cisco](http://www.cisco.com "Cisco Systems")
equipment. They sold us the equipment and peformed the original
installation. Unfortunately they had some issues that they were never
able to solve. Despite going up the ladder to the executive level, they
still were unable to properly configure
a [VPN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network "Virtual private network")
connection for us. More shocked than anything at their inability to
perform a core function of the companies competence, I terminated our
contract with them and began a search for a replacement.

My search took me to a number of places, some familar, like google, and
some new, like twitter.

I performed a search on twitter for Cisco and came across
[@blindhog](http://twitter.com/blindhog), a CNA with his [own
blog](http://blindhog.net) about Cisco Network configuration. Though we
hadn’t previously met, since I read his blog and followed him on
twitter, it wasn’t a ‘cold call’. I went into our first encounter
knowing two things.

1.  This guy knows what he is talking about. His blog completely
    demonstrated not only someone that had learned what he needed to to
    pass the CNA exam, but someone passionet about his work.  He is
    definately qualified to resolve our issue.
2.  Since I had read his writing, I knew a bit about him, his
    personality and glimpse into his character.

After a brief correspondence I hired him to perform the maintence on our
network. What the previous company couldn’t solve in 20+ hours of
trying, [@blindhog](http://twitter.com/blindhog) solved in less than 2
hours. The testing proved that the connection was fixed. Not only was
[@blindhog](http://twitter.com/blindhog)‘s rate at a competitive price,
but he finished the project in substantially less time.

Thanks to twitter and [@blindhog](http://twitter.com/blindhog), I was
able to find the resolution to our problems and with the additional
benefit of saving time and money.
