This post is a bit behind the actual releases, but should be announced
here nevertheless. Announcing the 3rd major release of spf13-vim.
spf13-vim is a distribution of vim plugins and resources for Vim, GVim
and MacVim. It is a completely cross platform distribution that stays
true to the feel of vim while providing modern features like a plugin
management system, autocomplete, tags and tons more. It grew out of my
vim configuration which I put on GitHub. As more an more people began to
use it contributions came back and flurished. It now ranks as one of the
top .5% of projects on github.Additionally I created a new site for this
project. [http://vim.spf13.com](http://vim.spf13.com) is entirely
powered by GitHub pages. If you would like to contribute, simply fork
spf13-vim, checkout the gh-pages branch and make a pull request.

The new site provides instructions on installing spf13-vim on any
platform and contains an overview of all the included modules along with
a getting started guide.
