One task that should be part of every IT managers is performing
reference checks on potential vendors. A vendor reference check goes
beyond the sales pitch to reveal the true nature of a product or
company. If you’re not performing reference checks you are susceptible
of falling prey to a slick sales pitch with nothing but trouble behind
it.

Vendors only provide the customers they are certain will give a glowing
endorsement. You need to know the right approach and the right questions
to ask. If you do, you can ascertain quickly if the vendor is right for
you.

Your purpose must be to determine if the vendor is:

-   Honest and Trustworthy
-   Reliable
-   Appropriately priced
-   Easy to work with
-   Performs well
-   Supportive

*If possible you should always ask for former clients as references. They
will likely be more honest about their relationship and reasons they are
no longer clients can be insightful.*

It’s important to first start at a high level, then drill down into the
specific services or products that you are looking to implement.
