Imagine
if [Apple](http://www.apple.com "Apple"), [Disney](http://disney.go.com "The Walt Disney Company"), [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com "Microsoft"),
etc had chased every oppotunity that they came across. One thing is
certain, you wouldn’t recognize their name today. Each of these
companies was successful because of extreme focus around a central
vision. As [Bill Cosby](http://www.billcosby.com/ "Bill Cosby") said..
“I don’t know the key to success but the key to failure is to try to
please everyone.”

[Bill
Gates](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/billg/default.mspx "Bill Gates")
achieved monumental success with Microsoft, and attributes “focus” as
the key to his success. He stated “maintaining focus is a key to
success. You should understand your circle of competence and spend your
time and energy there…I’ve learned that only through focus can you do
world-class things, no matter how capable you are.”

There are three central questions you need to be able to answer:

-   What is the goal?
-   What is our action based on (underlying principles)?
-   What is the purpose?

or in **3 words, Vision, Values, and Purpose.**
