[Drupal](http://www.drupal.org "Drupal") is a very powerful [content
management](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management "Content management")
solution. It powered an earlier version of this website as well as
[zoopframework.com](http://zoopframework.com). Drupal is a relatively
easy to use system, but there are a few key concepts that you really
need to understand in getting started. I often find that webcasts are
fantastic resources for instruction. I recently helped a non-techie
friend setup a drupal site and was surprised at how many (really bad)
drupal videos existed online. I have compiled some of the better ones
here as a resource and guide to getting started with Drupal.

I focused on getting started with Drupal, assuming you have already
installed Drupal. If you haven't yet 
[use Justin Hileman’s excellent
guide](http://justinhileman.info/articles/a-more-secure-drupal-multisite-install).
