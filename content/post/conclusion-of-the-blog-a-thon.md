Today marks the last post of my blog-a-thon. It has been a learning and
growing experience. I have blogged more time in the past 4 weeks as I
did the prior 52. It was challenging and rewarding.

I feel I have developed as a blogger and having 3 posts a week has
brought the blog to the front of my mind. Not only did I write many
articles, but I’ve started a bunch more and have ideas for even more
than that. Needless to say increasing the frequency of posts actually
increased my depth of topics and ideas.

Towards the end (this week) I started to run a bit out of steam. It was
a combination of a bunch of external forces that really squashed the
time I would have rather been blogging. Sometimes life is like that
though. Besides, this isn’t my day job. It wasn’t mission critical, it
was intended as a challenge and for fun. All in all it was a good
experience. I think I’d do it again, but probably not for a while.

I do think I will continue to blog more regularly, but probably more on
a one or two a week schedule as with my current work and family
responsibilities that seems a bit more practical.
