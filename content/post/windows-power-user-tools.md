I’m a huge fan of Windows 7. It’s the first time I’ve ever run a
Microsoft OS on my primary (home) machine.  I’ve compiled a set of
programs that I have found to be invaluable in using Windows for serious
development and computing. All are free and clean of any ads or spyware.

[EaseUS® Partition Master 9.1 Home Edition](http://www.partition-tool.com/personal.htm)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As Partition Magic alternative, EaseUS Partition Master Home Edition is
a ALL-IN-ONE partition solution and disk management freeware. It allows
you to extend partition (especially for system drive), manage disk space
easily, settle low disk space problem on MBR and GUID partition table
(GPT) disk under Windows 2000/XP/Vista/[Windows
7](http://www.partition-tool.com/resource/resize-partition-windows-7.htm) (SP1

[Process Hacker](http://sourceforge.net/projects/processhacker/)
----------------------------------------------------------------

{{% img src="/media/process_hacker.jpg" class="third right" alt="process hacker" %}}
Effectively a better version of Task Manager, Process Hacker is a free
and open source process viewer and memory editor with unique features
such as powerful process termination. It can show services, processes
and their threads, modules, handles and memory regions.

[TeraCopy](http://www.codesector.com/teracopy.php)
--------------------------------------------------

{{% img src="/media/teracopy.jpg" class="third right" alt="tera copy" %}}
TeraCopy is designed to copy and move files at the maximum possible
speed. The program skips bad files during the copying process, and then
displays them at the end of the transfer so that you can see which ones
need attention. TeraCopy can automatically check the copied files for
errors by calculating their CRC checksum values. It also provides a lot
more information about the files being copied than its Windows
counterpart. TeraCopy integrates with Windows Explorer’s right-click
menu and can be set as the default copy handler. It replaces Explores
copy and move functionality and instead provides excellent move and copy
support.

[WinDirStat](http://windirstat.info/)
-------------------------------------

{{% img src="/media/windirstat.jpg" class="third right" alt="WinDirStat" %}}
WinDirStat is a disk usage statistics viewer and cleanup tool for
Microsoft Windows. It works well and is very fast.

[Write Monkey](http://writemonkey.com)
--------------------------------------

Write Monkey is a knock off of the Write Room full screen distraction
free applications for OS X. It’s quite well done and free.
