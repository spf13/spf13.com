There are a variety of reasons businesses either do not have a disaster
recovery plan or their current plan is substandard.  The beliefs of the
people in charge of developing these processes (business owners and IT
department) play a significant role in how effective the overall
strategy will be.  This is problematic when the decision-makers have
bought into one or more of the common myths surrounding disaster
recovery.

Myth – Disaster Recovery is Expensive and Resource Intensive
------------------------------------------------------------

One of the biggest reasons businesses put off developing a disaster
recovery strategy is because they believe it will become too expensive
and resource intensive.  As a result, they view it as more of a luxury
than a necessity.  The truth is as technology continues to evolve; the
costs associated with disaster recovery continue to fall. 
Virtualization, standardization, and automation have all played key
roles in making disaster recovery more affordable.  They have reduced
the number of people required to restore systems which significantly
decreases personnel costs.  In fact, a streamlined disaster recovery
strategy can require only one person.  Virtualization also reduces the
initial capital investment because redundant physical infrastructure is
no longer necessary.

Myth – After Planning, There is No Way to Accurately Run a Test
---------------------------------------------------------------

Many businesses suffer from an ineffective disaster recovery plan and
don’t even realize it.  This is because they do not believe a full-scale
test is possible without significantly disrupting day-to-day
activities.  Virtualization allows recovery plans to be tested against
significant failures multiple times to ensure the plan is consistently
effective, without disrupting day-to-day activities.  Not only are tests
easy to run, but virtualization also eliminates the need to transport
the IT team to multiple locations.

Myth – Creating and Managing a Disaster Recovery Solution Requires “Special” Skills
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A common hesitation, especially among small businesses, is the belief
that developing a disaster recovery solution requires a special set of
skills.  This myth largely stems from traditional manual data recovery
because end-users had to deal with duplicate, silent infrastructures
across multiple sites.  Virtualization standardizes the disaster
recovery process by encapsulating operating systems, applications, and
servers.  This includes all the configuration data.  As a result, the
entire process is now much less complex than it used to be. 
Additionally, once the solution is in place it can be reliably tested
and executed by staff.  Since this is all taken care of via automated
processes, no special skills are required.

Myth – Disaster Recovery Plans Are like an Insurance Policy that Never Gets Used
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The most common myths which prevent businesses from taking disaster
recovery seriously are that it is unnecessary.  They believe disaster
recovery is a sunk cost similar to a car insurance policy of someone who
never gets an accident.  Even if a disaster never happens, the recovery
plan still provides a variety of benefits to the business.  One of the
most common uses is as a migration plan template anytime a business
switches data centers.  Depending upon the industry, disaster recovery
plans may also be a compliance requirement. In order to accurately
assess the need for a new or [improved disaster recovery
plan](http://www.datafoundry.com/disaster-recovery/) these myths must be
eliminated from a business’s belief structure.  As long as these myths
remain, the odds of successfully implementing an efficient disaster
recovery strategy are slim. Tony Spinks believes every company should
consider using Disaster recovery services.  These services are critical
for keeping businesses running after system failures.  Data Centers
offering disaster recovery services provide the redundancy.
