# Steve Francia's Website

This is the source for http://spf13.com. I use [Hugo](http://hugo.spf13.com) to
take the source here and create a static site which can be found at [spf13](http://spf13.com)

Hugo, is new idea around making website creation simple again. Hugo
flexibly works with many formats and is ideal for blogs, docs,
portfolios and much more. Hugo's speed fosters creativity and makes
building a website fun again.

I hope this site can serve as a good example for anyone using [Hugo](http://spf13.com).
